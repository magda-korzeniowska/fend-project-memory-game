## Project Description

Students were given [a starter project](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) with some HTML and CSS styling displaying a static version of the Memory Game project. 
A main goal was to convert this static project into an interactive one, modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## How to Play

- game goal - match all 16 cards into 8 pairs in the smallest number of moves

- rating: 
  - 3 stars: up to 10 moves
  - 2 stars: 11-14 moves
  - 1 star: more than 14 moves
